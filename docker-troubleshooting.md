# Docker Connection Troubleshooting Guide

If Docker fails to connect, follow these steps to troubleshoot the issue:

## 1. Check Docker Service Status

Ensure that the Docker service is running. Use the following command to check the status:

```sh
sudo systemctl status docker
```

If the service is not running, start it with:

```sh
sudo systemctl start docker
```

## 2. Check Docker Daemon Logs

Look for any errors in the Docker daemon logs. Use the following command to view the logs:

```sh
sudo journalctl -u docker
```

## 3. Verify Docker Configuration

Ensure that Docker is configured correctly. Check the Docker configuration file (usually located at `/etc/docker/daemon.json`) for any misconfigurations.

## 4. Restart Docker

Sometimes, simply restarting Docker can resolve connection issues. Use the following command to restart Docker:

```sh
sudo systemctl restart docker
```
